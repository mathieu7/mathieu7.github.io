###### Hi, I'm Matt.

![Hi, I'm Matt](/assets/P3.jpg)

I'm a software engineer out of New Jersey. I've worked as a Full Stack Engineer,
but primarily as an Android Developer since 2011.

###### My interests

I'm a tinkerer; I love reading code and getting a good feel for how something works.
I love creating things that make my life as a developer easier, and hopefully for others.
I love doing side projects that allow me to learn a new or existing paradigm as a byproduct
of making something useful.
